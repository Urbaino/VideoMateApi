## Timer
Every interval specified in config by `SequencerIntervalSeconds` a service will search all the .json files in `DataPath` folder and check if they have status `categorized`. If they do, every sequence specified in the .json file will be generated by ffmpeg, output in the same folder. When this is done for all categories, the .json file status is changed to `sequences_has_been_processed`.
